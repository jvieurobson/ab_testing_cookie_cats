    "Cookie Cats is a hugely popular mobile puzzle game developed by Tactile Entertainment. It's a classic \"connect three\"-style puzzle game where the player must connect tiles of the same color to clear the board and win the level.  As players progress through the levels of the game, they will occasionally encounter gates that force them to wait a non-trivial amount of time or make an in-app purchase to progress. In addition to driving in-app purchases, these gates serve the important purpose of giving players an enforced break from playing the game, hopefully resulting in that the player's enjoyment of the game being increased and prolonged. \n",

    "Tactile Games are interested in assessing how they can increase in-game purchases within Cookie Cats. Based on user-research, Tactile Games will have come up with a basic hypothesis that changing the gate placement within the game will lead to greater retention rates and therefore, greater in-game purchases.\n",
